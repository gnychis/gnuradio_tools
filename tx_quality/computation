1. Declare int variables a, b, c, d. (They could be doubles if you would
prefer.)

2. Declare double variables sum1, sum2, mean, std_dev

3. Get user inputs into a, b, c, d

4. Set sum1 = a+b+c+d;

5. Set mean = (double)sum1/4.0

6. Set sum2 = (a-mean)*(a-mean) + (b-mean)*(b-mean)
+(c-mean)*(c-mean)+(d-mean)*(d-mean)

7. set std_dev = sqrt((1.0/4.0)*(double)sum2)
